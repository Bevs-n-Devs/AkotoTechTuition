# VARIABLE CHALLENGE
print('*'*3, 'VARIABLE CHALLENGE', '*'*3)

# 1. Create a variable called `my_name` and store your name in it, then print out the message.
#    The print message should say: "Hello, my name is --"
#    `--` = This is where your `my_name` variable should be.
my_name = 'Yaw Akoto'

print('My name is', my_name)



# 2. Calculate your age by creating a variable called `current_year` and save the current 
#    year in it. Now create another variable called `birth_year` and save the year that you were born in.
#    Create a variable called `age` to do the calculation by subtracting `birth_year` 
#    from `current_year` like this: current_year - birth_year.
#    Now print out your age. The print message should say: "I am -- years old." 
#    `--` = This is where your `age` variable should be. 
#    CLUE: Look at how I have used print statements in previous examples for guidance.
current_year = 2024
birth_year = 1986
age = current_year - birth_year

print('I am', age, 'years old.')        # notice we do not need to add spaces in print message



# 3. Create a variable called `fav_number`, store your favourite number in it, and then create 
#    another variable called `result` where we multiply your favourite number by 2. (Remember, * is used for multiplication).
#    Now print out the result. The print message should say: "My favourite number doubled is --"
#    `--` = This is where your `result` variable should be.
fav_number = 16
result = fav_number * 2

print('My favourite number doubled is', result)
