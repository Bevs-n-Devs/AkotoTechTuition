# Week 10: Snake Game

This week we will create a **Snake Game** using Python from [my repository](https://github.com/PythonAkoto/SnakeGame/tree/master).

Over the two days, we will cover how to create a repo for the game, the steps to incrementally create and update the game, and to save the changes to the repository.

We will also then create a custom version of the repo in a new branch and create a merge request to merge the new changes into the main branch.

## Day 1: Repo Setup and Incremental Steps
- Create Snake Game repo
- Create virtual enviornment and install required libraries/packages
- Steps 1 - 5

## Day 2: Incremental Steps, Creating Our Custom Version & Merge Request
- Steps 6 - 7
- The use of `.gitnore` and creating requirements file by using `pip freeze`
- Updating `README.md` file 
- Making a Pull Request for steps 1 - 7 in repo
- Creating a new branch for step 8 - custom changes to game
- Merge new branch to master branch
