# Build Portfolio
We will combine what we have learned from Week 11 to create our own portfolio, which will have a small description about ourselves, pictures from the web that describes our personality, along with our favourite hobbies and a quiz for users to complete.

The portfolio will be selected from [w3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp), where we will use the [Black & White Portfolio Template](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_bw_portfolio.htm) as the default.
